### Some Computationally Generated Poetry
*Drawing on the Web, Spring 2019: Final Project*

---
### Outline

For my final project, I have decided that I would like to use this opportunity to display the work I have been creating for another class I am currently taking, *Reading and Writing Electronic Texts*. In this course, I have been repeatedly tasked with devising new programs to create computer generated poetry. As crazy or unique as it may sound, I’ve had a great time throughout the course and have made some pieces that I am quite proud of. Currently all my work for that course is just sitting in Jupyter Notebooks; with what I’ve learned in *Drawing on the Web*, I’d like to create a virtual environment that puts on display the uniqueness of this method of poetry writing.

My plan is to create 4 pages: a page each for [*Chain Abstractions*](https://github.com/erinachavez/rwet_spring2019/tree/master/assignment4_031219), [*Synesthesia Sentences*](https://github.com/erinachavez/rwet_spring2019/tree/master/assignment5_040219), and my final project poem still under development, as well as a navigation page linking the three together. Since I’d like my pages to be as dynamic as the code outputs can be, and that each of my poems are written in Python, I will set up a simple Flask API server to call poem outputs. My intention with each page is to visualize the poem text and intent. For example, with *Synesthesia Sentences*, I’m hoping to take the matplotlib visualizations I made, improve on them, and animatedly draw them to the browser whilst the poem is displayed. Please see my prototype to gain a better idea of what I’m imagining for my final drawings.
